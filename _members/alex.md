Alex completed his undergraduate degree in Biochemistry at the University of Bath, graduating in 2020. This included a placement year at the Garvan Institute in Sydney where he undertook research into lymphocyte activation and adhesion in the context of primary immunodeficiencies. Subsequently, Alex held a research assistant position in Prof. Benny Chain's group where he worked alongside Achilles Therapeutics to develop novel activation marker assays for identification and tracking of neoantigen-reactive T cells in cancer patients undergoing adoptive cellular immunotherapies.

Alex is now continuing his work into the anti-cancer immune response for his PhD in the Roychoudhuri Group, as part of the MRC DTP programme. His work is focussed on the metabolic adaptations of T cells to the tumour microenvironment (TME) and the consequent impacts on effector function.
