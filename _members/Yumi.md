Yumi completed her BA/MSc in Medical Sciences and PhD in Medicine at the University of Tsukuba, Japan. During her PhD and postdoctoral studies, she focused, with a special interest in <b>immunology</b>, on the functional analysis of immunoreceptors including CD226 and TIGIT, and their ligand (CD155) in Treg cell functions/stability and Th1/Th2 immune responses. These studies explored the potential for therapeutic applications targeting these molecules. She also contributed to the clinical development of humanized antibodies against human CD226 at TNAX Biopharma Corporation.

Yumi joined Rahul Roychoudhuri's lab in November 2021 as a postdoctoral researcher, supported by JSPS. She is currently a Research Associate funded by the BBSRC and is interested in immune suppression, focusing on regulatory T (Treg) cells, with the aim of discovering novel mechanisms of <b>Treg cell maintenance</b>, and developing new therapeutic strategies for cancer and autoimmune diseases.
